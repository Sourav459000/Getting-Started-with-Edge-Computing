# Getting Started with Edge Computing

Welcome to the Getting Started with Edge Computing repository! This repository is aimed at beginners who are interested in exploring edge computing and AI through hands-on projects using various microcontrollers.

## Introduction
Edge computing is a paradigm where data processing is performed closer to the source of data generation rather than relying on a centralized data processing system. This approach offers several advantages such as reduced latency, improved reliability, and enhanced privacy. Combining edge computing with AI technologies opens up exciting possibilities for creating intelligent edge devices capable of performing complex tasks locally.

## About This Repository
This repository serves as a collection of basic lab projects and mini projects designed to help you get started with edge computing and AI on microcontrollers. Whether you're a hobbyist, student, or professional looking to delve into edge computing, you'll find useful resources and project ideas here.

## How to Use This Repository
- Each project is organized into subfolders based on the level.
- Navigate to the respective subfolder to find project-specific instructions and resources.
- Follow the instructions provided in each project to set up your hardware, deploy the necessary software, and run the project.
