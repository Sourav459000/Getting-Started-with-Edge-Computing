**Title:**  
Alternate Blinking LED Code for Raspberry Pi 4 Model B

**Requirements:**
- Raspberry Pi 4 Model B
- LEDs from Grove Kit (connected to GPIO pins 18 and 17)
- Raspbian OS installed on Raspberry Pi
- Python 3.x installed
- RPi.GPIO library installed (`pip install RPi.GPIO`)

**Procedure:**
1. **Setup Hardware:**
   - Connect two LEDs from the Grove Kit to GPIO pins 18 and 17 on the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B. Ensure proper connections and polarity. ![GPIO Pinout Reference](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/images/GPIO-Pinout-Diagram-2.png)
   
2. **Install Required Libraries:**
   - Open the terminal on your Raspberry Pi.
   - Install the RPi.GPIO library by running the following command:
     ```
     pip install RPi.GPIO
     ```

3. **Download the Alternate Blinking LED Code:**
   - Create a new Python file on your Raspberry Pi using your preferred text editor (e.g., Nano, Vim, Thonny).
   - Copy and paste the code from main.py.

4. **Run the Code:**
   - Save the Python file with an appropriate name, for example, `alternate_blink_led.py`.
   - Open the terminal and navigate to the directory where the Python file is located.
   - Run the Python script.
   - The two LEDs connected to GPIO pins 18 and 17 should start blinking alternately at one-second intervals.
   - Press `Ctrl + C` to stop the script and exit.

**Conclusion:**
This README provides a step-by-step guide to set up and run a Python script on the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B to make two LEDs connected to GPIO pins 18 and 17 blink alternately using the RPi.GPIO library. Following these instructions, you can easily create projects with alternating LED blinking effects on your Raspberry Pi.
